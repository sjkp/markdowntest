UIkit's Width component is often used in combination with grids to split content into responsive columns. You can apply fractions, automatic width or expand units to fill the remaining space and combine these modes.


We remove redundancy into each set of unit classes, so that for instance instead of .uk-width-3-6 you should use .uk-width-1-2.

```
<div uk-grid>
    <div class="uk-width-1-2"></div>
    <div class="uk-width-1-2"></div>
</div>
```
